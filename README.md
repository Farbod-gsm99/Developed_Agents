# Developed AI Agents

In this repository, some AI agentic workflow codes are pushed which are done under the guidance of Huggingface Agents Course.

One other agent (in LangGraph framework) is also designed who has the ability to find a leak from the databse related to a game, categorize it according to the list of game it's assigned, search the internet or a database for the reliability of the leak, and then write a post regarding the leak to be posted on social media.
